        <p style="margin-left: 3vh; font-weight: 700;">
            Happy 18th birthday to the most amazing person in my life. We've experienced so much together — the ups, the downs, the worries, and everything in between. Yet, here we are, growing stronger than ever. Through it all, you've remained as bright as the day we first met, but now, you're blooming like a beautiful sunflower, radiating even more warmth and grace with every passing day.
            <br> <br>
            I can't help but admire how much you've grown — not just in age, but in wisdom, strength, and beauty. Watching you become the incredible person you are today fills my heart with so much love and pride. I am so lucky to have you in my life.
            <br> <br>
            I love you more than words can express, and I'm so grateful to have you in my life. Happy birthday, my love. Here's to forever, together, with God guiding us every step of the way.            <br> <br>
        </p>
